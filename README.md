# my-dotfiles...
ONLY FOR SWAY CHAD PEOPLE!!

basically sum config files to set up my sway linux computer!!

# MANDATORY PACKAGES:
- sway (duh)
- waybar
- pamixer
- neofetch
- wofi

# INSTALLATION:
cant find a proper way to install the config files, soo just copy and paste them to ~/.config, by the way the neofetch config file has its ascii set to linuxmint_small since it was made in linux mint, so change it if you are on another distro lol

# KEYBINDS:
- mod + 1-9 = workspaces
- mod + left, right/up, down = focus on the respective window
- mod + alt + up/down = volume
- mod + d = wofi
- mod + enter = terminal
- mod + q = close focused window

# NOTES:
feel free to change anything from ts, although i made it to archive my config files
